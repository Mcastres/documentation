The feature allows Strapi users to easily and natively create, manage and distribute content in several languages.

The i18n is an optional plugin that you can [install from the Marketplace]()

## Goals and non-goals

This plugin:

- allows Admin panel users to create several localized versions of their content 
- allows Frontend developers to build localized projects by fetching and consuming the right content depending on the country/language of the audience.

This plugin **does not**:

- translate the users' content
- adapt the Admin interface to languages specificities (for instance display the Admin in Right To Left (RTL) format)
