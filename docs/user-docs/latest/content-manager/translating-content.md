# Translating content

With the Internationalization plugin installed, it is possible to manage content in more than one language. To manage content in a specific language, the latter must be added beforehand through the Internationalization settings (see Configuring Internationalization locales).

In the Content Manager, when the Internationalization plugin is installed, some options are added to the edit view:

- an Internationalization box, displayed in the right side of the interface, from where it is possible to switch locales
- [] and [] icons, displayed next to every field, to respectively specify whether the field can be translated or not

::: warning IMPORTANT
Content can only be managed one locale at the time. It is not possible to edit or publish content several locales at the same time (e.g. Clicking on the **Publish** button will only publish the content for the locale you are currently working on).
:::

To translate content in another locale:

1. Access the edit view of your collection or single type.
2. In the Internationalization box, click on the *Locales* drop-down list.
3. Choose the locale in which you want to translate your content.
4. Translate your content (see Write your content). 

::: tip ðŸ’¡ TIP
Click on the **Fill in form** button in the Internationalization box for all fields to be filled up with the values of another chosen locale. It can be useful if you do not remember what was the exact content in another locale.
